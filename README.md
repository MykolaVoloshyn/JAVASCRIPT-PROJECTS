### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu to order a pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.

### Tic-Tac_toe Game
Classic tic-tac-toe game against the computer. The computer randomly chooses where to place the token after checking which fields are still empty. When a winning combination is detected, an animation of a line passing through the tokens appears and the winning music plays.

### Calculator
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
